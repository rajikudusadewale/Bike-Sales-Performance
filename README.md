# I analyzed bike sales dataset, and created a Bike Sales Performance Dashboard using Excel.
The bike company want to know what influenced Individual customers that got a bike, what's attributes customers that got bikes and the ones that didnt possess. 

The dashboard consists of various charts and slicers that provide insights into bike sales performance based on parameters such as customer demographics, customer distance, occupation, income, and age bracket. In this report, I will present the trends and insights obtained from the dashboard, draw conclusions and provide recommendations.

### Steps I took are highligted below:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed 26 duplicate values, to avoid data redundancy. Left with 1000 unique values.
- **Data Processing & Manipulation:** I changed some columns data to what we can easily comprehend in visualization. In the marital status column, M text was replaced with Married, while S text was replaced with Single. In the Gender column, M was replaced with Male, while F was replaced with Female. I added a new column for Age Bracket (<31=adolescent, >=31 =middle age, >50 = Old).  
- **Data Visualization and Reporting:** Used Pivot  to create the dashboard.
